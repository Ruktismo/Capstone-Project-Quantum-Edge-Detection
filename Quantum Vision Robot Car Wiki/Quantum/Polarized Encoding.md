So when we encode the circuit we add an aux q-bit, and when we decode we only grab the odd bit-strings. So only half of the q-bits are used, and I am wondering if can make use of the other half of the q-bits. 

If that is possible then in the same number of q-bits we can encode double the information, allowing us to encode the vertical image along with the horizontal in one circuit.
