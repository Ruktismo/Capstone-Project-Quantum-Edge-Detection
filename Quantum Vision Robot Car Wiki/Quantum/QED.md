Quantum Edge Detection ([[QED]]) is used by our [[Quantum]] team to quickly find the edges in an image. 
Most of the theory and code comes from the [[Qiskit]] Python module. A reference to their paper on it can be found [here](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-applications/quantum-edge-detection).  
Note that the paper is a bit old, running on [[Qiskit]]v0.25.4 and we are using [[Qiskit]]v0.41.0. So some parts of the code have changed but the general theory described in the paper still applies.

Below we will be going through some examples using our code.
