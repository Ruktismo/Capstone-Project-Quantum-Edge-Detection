We are using Quantum Edge Detection ([[QED]]) to quickly fine the edges in our image.






# Possible Optimizations
Below is a list of optimizations that can maybe be done to speed up and/or increase accuracy in the QED. We do not know if any of these will work, we still need to look into them.
  - [[Polarized Encoding]]
  - [[Boundary Error Fix]]
  - [[Image Mapping via Pairing Function]]
